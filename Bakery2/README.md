#### _An application for the owner of a bakery to add new vendors and add new orders for their vendors, October 2019_

#### By _**Lauren Musante**_

## Description

_This is a website for Pierre, the owner of the bakery from Week 9's independent code review project. There is a homepage that offers an option to either view a list of current vendors, or to add a new vendor. The "add new vendor" option will take Pierre to a form where he can enter a vendor's detailed information. Pierre can add as many vendors as he'd like. While viewing the list of vendors, Pierre can click on the vendor name and be taken to a new form to fill out an order for that particular vendor. This site is to keep track of Pierre's vendors and orders, including what the orders are for and when they were made._
